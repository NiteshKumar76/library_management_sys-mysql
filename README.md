📚 Library Management System using SQL
This project is a simple Library Management System designed to demonstrate the use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing library-related operations such as book records, member information, and issue/return transactions.

🔍 Features:
Add, update, and delete books from the catalog

Register and manage library members

Issue and return books with due date tracking

View reports such as issued books, overdue books, and member activity

Ensure data integrity using constraints and relationships (foreign keys, primary keys, etc.)

🛠️ Technologies Used:
SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite — specify which one you used)

(Optional) Frontend or interface: Python CLI / Web (if any)

(Optional) Tools: MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, etc.

📁 Structure:
schema.sql – Contains all the table creation and constraint definitions

data.sql – Sample data for testing

queries.sql – SQL queries for various operations

(Optional) Any code files or interface scripts

🚀 How to Run:
Import the schema.sql to your SQL database.

Run data.sql to populate with sample data.

Use the queries in queries.sql to interact with the system.

Would you like me to generate a README.md for the repository too?

# 📚 Library Management System using SQL

This is a simple **Library Management System** built using **SQL** to manage book records, member details, and lending operations. It demonstrates database design, data handling, and query execution for a library setup.

## ✅ Features

- Add, update, delete books
- Register and manage library members
- Issue and return books
- Track overdue books
- View book and member reports
- Ensure data consistency using foreign keys and constraints

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- SQL (e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – _specify your DBMS here_)
- (Optional) MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin / DB Browser for SQLite
- (Optional) Frontend: Python / Web Interface / CLI – _if applicable_

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- A SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or command-line interface)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-sql.git
Open your SQL client and import schema.sql to create the database schema.

Import data.sql to insert sample records.

Use the SQL queries in queries.sql to perform operations.

💡 Example Queries
View all available books:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM books WHERE is_issued = FALSE;
List overdue books:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM issued_books WHERE return_date < CURRENT_DATE;
📌 Notes
This project is for educational purposes.

You can expand it by adding triggers, procedures, or integrating it with a frontend.
