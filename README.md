## 📘 Introduction

The **Library Management System** is a structured relational database solution developed using SQL. It is designed to support and automate core library operations including book inventory management, member registrations, book issuance and returns, and overdue tracking. This project demonstrates the use of SQL in real-world data organization, integrity maintenance, and query execution.

## 📂 Project Objectives

- Efficiently manage book and member records.
- Enable secure tracking of issued and returned books.
- Automate due date calculations and fine assessments.
- Provide clear insights into book availability and overdue items.
- Serve as a backend foundation for future UI/UX integration.
